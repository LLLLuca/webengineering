# Dynamic Conent with the Firebase Real-Time Database

This week introduces dynamic content and the different approaches to achieve this. We are dealing with a JavaScript-based approach in combination with the Firebase Real-Time Database.

You'll find 3 examples in week 6:

- Lesson 1: Simple reading data from Firebase and displaying a text string in the h1 element
- Lesson 2: Read a product list from Firebase and display it in a web page
- Lesson 3: Create a simple chat application using read and *write* functionality
