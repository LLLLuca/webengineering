## Login with Google

The example extends the standard login form using email and password with a new button to sign in with your Google account. For this to work, you'll need to adjust two settings in your [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/):

1. Enable Google Authentication (Authentication -> Methods -> Provider)
2. Add your Cloud9 domain (e.g. `<workspace>-<username>.c9users.io`) to the list of allowed domains (Authentication -> Methods -> Authorized Domains)
